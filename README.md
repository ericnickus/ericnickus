### :hammer_and_wrench: Languages and Tools :

About Me :
(the past two and half years)- 
- ðŸ”­ Tightening up on Javascript and node.js applications and React as well.  Worked a lot doing data scraping for a tile website , scraping over half a million products from three major different sites.  Continuing to do websites for customers and projects for a private entrepeneur .  Also completing a project reading .wav files and mixing multiple .wav files and comparing them.  

- :telescope: While Iâ€™m working on being a professional blockchain developer and web3 and crypto development, I run my own web developement service. Also consulting on projects that I have expert knowledge in such as RETS projects for Real Estate websites ,and relational database design, integrations and optimization, Data Scraping from major retailer's websites, parsing .wav files and mixing them utilizing ffmpeg and other libraries in node,js with React.js . I also still do create from scratch websites and maintain and fix problems for my smaller customers websites needs and I also handle a pretty good flow of incoming tech work such as fixing problems, wiping hard drives, data recovery, maintenance and upgrading all kinds of laptops and pcs and tablets.  Work is consistent micronotebook.com, decorativestone.com and several others.  Working on a personal website coming soon.  Also completed my own personal mp3 music player showcasing some music ideas I have for my older 2 albums of music material .  Other websites I have coded are at smsold.com gallery and more.  

- :ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m willing to collaborate on cool hackathon ideas or blockchain projects or startups utilizing blockchain technology.

-: More recently I entered my first hackathon (IPFS /Filecoin) where I collaborated with several other teammates on a project that was one of the final winners in the hackathon, so I am really excited about hackathons and all kinds of web3 activities.

- Data Scraping. Node.js applications, React applications.
- Parsing of metadata in raw .wav files .



- :My strengths are: very strong communication skils with all people from upper management to end users. (Strong communication doesn't just mean talking, it also means listening). A positive attitude -not afraid of learning new technologies  /new ways to do things, very detail oriented, down to validating  css and html and optimizing javascript where possible with zero errors.  I play well with others. I also do well by myself. I have no issues with handling stuff like admin duties, fixing issues that come up, learning new things all while doing a regular schedule of programming assignments.  
- 

- : I am more mature now (50) but still active like a young man I have no physical issues, still play sports, etc.  I started learing programming before the internet so I have a very broad scope of view point on projects, and how to be most efficient at getting things done.  Once I get acclimated to your setup, I am definitely a goto guy you can leave in there by myself or the one you call when you need extra help figuring out a problem.  I am not a hider I will tell you everything I know with 100 percent honesty.
