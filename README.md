### :hammer_and_wrench: Languages and Tools :

About Me :
(the past two and half years)- 
- ðŸ”­ Working on smart contracts (solidity and EOS).  I also have learned a LOT over the past couple years;  a few new programming languages such as Typescript, React, Solidity, C++ and other blockchain stuff like running my own Bitcoin node, setting up an ethereum node, setting up a backend with Moralis or whatever platform to use to test Ethereum smart contracts ,Truffle, Alchemy, Hardhat, Remix, etc.  Not to mention spending time working with EOS and other blockchains besides Ethereum. Continuing to learn about even more ways to make smart contracts like LUKSO, AlGORAND and others. My goal is to be a smart contract developer full time.   But willing to do part blockchain and part full stack duties if needed.  

- :telescope: While Iâ€™m working on being a professional blockchain developer and web3 and crypto development, I run my own web developement service. Also consulting on projects that I have expert knowledge in such as RETS projects for Real Estate websites ,and relational database design, integrations and optimization, etc . I also still do create from scratch websites and maintain and fix problems for my smaller customers websites needs and I also handle a pretty good flow of incoming tech work such as fixing problems, wiping hard drives, data recovery, maintenance and upgrading all kinds of laptops and pcs and tablets.  Work is consistent but I am focused on acheiving my goal of becoming a serious blockchain developer and soon I will hire someone else to do this while I focus on blockchain projects only.  Latest website I designed and coded: micronotebook.com.  Other websites I have coded are at smsold.com gallery and more.  

- :ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m willing to collaborate on cool hackathon ideas or blockchain projects or startups utilizing blockchain technology.

-: More recently I entered my first hackathon (IPFS /Filecoin) where I collaborated with several other teammates on a project that was one of the final winners in the hackathon, so I am really excited about hackathons and all kinds of web3 activities.

- :zap: In my past history, I have actual work experience on these platforms:
- :AS400 (rpg/cl)
- :C
- :Javascript
- :.net /. C#
- :LAMP Stack(PHP/Mysql)
- :rets developer (MLS data- real estate websites) rets data integrations, RETS data expert
- :MYSQL back end development / database integrations from mls databases to proprietary and creating and designing databases with very large amounts of data that maintain themselves every 15 minutes updating, deleting and adding new data and using my own personal photo files folder storage system which handles like a million photos not a problem.
- :custom javascript maps ; creating a drawing tool map like zillow from scratch.
- :front end development creating from .psd many websites on smsold.com portfolio both from scratch and utilizing CMS such as Cake and Wordpress.
- :Much experience in consulting, talking with end users and basically solving problems with web applications debugging javascript and my next goal is making web3 applications for a established corporation or company. 



- :My strengths are: very strong communication skils with all people from upper management to end users. (Strong communication doesn't just mean talking, it also means listening). A positive attitude -not afraid of learning new technologies  /new ways to do things, very detail oriented, down to validating  css and html and optimizing javascript where possible with zero errors.  I play well with others. I also do well by myself. I have no issues with handling stuff like admin duties, fixing issues that come up, learning new things all while doing a regular schedule of programming assignments.  
- 

- : I am more mature now (50) but still active like a young man I have no physical issues, still play sports, etc.  I started learing programming before the internet so I have a very broad scope of view point on projects, and what can and cannot be done.  Once I get acclimated to your setup, I am definitely a goto guy you can leave in there by myself or the one you call when you need extra help figuring out a problem.  I am not a hider I will tell you everything I know with 100 percent honesty.
